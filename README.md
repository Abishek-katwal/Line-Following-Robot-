This repo contains code and docs for my 4th semester minor project: a basic motor control system using Arduino Uno, L298N motor driver, TT gear motors, and lithium-ion battery. It demonstrates key concepts in embedded systems and motor control, laying groundwork for future robotics and AIoT innovations.
